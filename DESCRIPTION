Title: Save and Load Variant Data to/from File
Version: 0.98.0
Date: 2022-09-28
Description:
    Save variant calling SummarizedExperiment to file and load them back as VCF objects.
    This is a more portable alternative to serialization of such objects into RDS files.
    Each artifact is associated with metadata for further interpretation;
    downstream applications can enrich this metadata with context-specific properties.
